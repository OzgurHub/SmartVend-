Glossary of Key C++ Concepts
----------------------------------

class:
A 'class' is like a blueprint for creating custom objects.
It groups together data (called attributes) and actions (called methods).
Used to structure and manage related data and behaviour.

Example:
class Product {
    // Defines product name, price, and actions like purchase()
};

public:
'public' means members (like variables or methods) can be accessed from outside the class.
This is used when other parts of the program need to use these members.

Example:
public:
    string name;
    void purchase();

vector:
A 'vector' is a resizable list from the C++ Standard Library.
It stores collections of elements, such as products in a vending machine.
It adjusts its size automatically as items are added or removed.

Example:
vector<Product> items;

Also commonly used headers:
#include <vector>  // brings in the vector container
#include <string>  // lets you use words and text (not just numbers)
